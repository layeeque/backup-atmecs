Gandhi is just not a man who brought the independence to India but it's an ideology who has given a secret to live a prosperous and peaceful life. It was his ideology and principles only which brought the independence to India by the way of non-violence. Our PM Narendra Modi is a strong follower of Gandhian principles. His all the policies and schemes are inspired from the Gandhian ideology. If we take the example of "Swachch Bharat", It is inspired from Gandhian principles of cleanliness, Because he believed that only healthy and clean environment can lead to prosperous India. Even the logo of Swachch Bharat is inspired from Gandhiji's spectacles. In India, Government policies and schemes are percolated directly to the grassroot level of rural India, It is possible only because of the adaption of decentralization of power of government. This idea of decentralization was given by Gandhi because he believed that the real India lives in villages and India cannot develop unless these people are developed. The Idea of fundamental rights and DPSP were strongly supported by Gandhi. It was Gandhi who always supported equal status for women and brought them in the mainstream struggle for independence. He believed that women are 50 % of the population and without their active support, independence is not impossible. Today we can see women on each and every higher position of the administration. Today Gandhi is not with us but the traces of his ideology and principles are present everywhere. Every Individual should not, only run behind the Gandhi's photo (currency) but strive to bring the presence of his ideology in his daily life.
