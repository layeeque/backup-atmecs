It has been a very long since I have heard from you. How have you been? I hope this letter finds you in the best of your health and spirit. I was thrilled to see the photos of your holiday tour on facebook- did you enjoy your time away? I'm writing this letter to surprise you with the good news. After being in the US for last 5 years, Now I am back in India and decided to settle down here permanently. 
 It was a very long period in the US where I have missed my friends, relatives, festival celebrations and almost everything. In this 5 years, I have toured almost all the major places in the US, the architecture, the beauty, the sceneries here are mesmerizing but the real essence of Indian culture was missing. One thing which I missed the most was Indian marriages and all its related events. Marriages in the US looks like official programmes which are without any fun. Last week when I came back, I was stunned to see the difference in the progress made by India in the last 5 years. It was totally different from India which I left back 5 years ago. I was proud to see the development, and I say you soon India will come in the category of developed countries. But one thing which shocked me was the situation in the slums. India has gone far in the development leaving slums behind as it was. I hope the government will soon take actions for its development also.
 Next Sunday I am organizing a small get together for our friends. I hope you won't make any excuses. So be present on Sunday at my residence at 7 pm. We will have a blast and revival of past memories
  Give my regards to uncle,aunt and my love to your younger brother.
Take care,
Best,
A.B.c
