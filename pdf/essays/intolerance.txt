Intolerance is a condition in which an individual /society does not accept, appreciate the practices and behaviors of others only because they do not like them or they do not belong to their religion. In a country like India where unity in diversity is an identity of India, intolerance is a big shame for any democratic country. I will only accept the people who are of my caste creed or religion, people having such kind of thinking are the most selfish persons in the world and are solely responsible for creating instability, due to intolerance in the country.  The basic reason for arising of intolerance is religion. People start to create a divide between the one who is of other religion which eventually leads to enmity, disrespect for others and finally war in the society. If anyone wants his religion to be respected he should respect the religion of others because respect in return gives respect. In India where people of different caste, creed, religion live together, celebrate each other's festivals, help each other in need that too with harmony and respect. The only way by which intolerance can be deaccelerated from the society is by dialogue and awareness among the people.Being intolerant is easy for an individual whereas being tolerant and accepting, respecting others as they are, is one the biggest quality of a human being. Everyone should kill the devil of intolerance in their heart and sow the seeds of tolerance because the way of intolerance leads to only devastation and hatred whereas tolerance has love and affection on its way
