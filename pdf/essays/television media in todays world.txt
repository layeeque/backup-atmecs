One Sunday when I was relaxing on my couch and flipping the channels I found that none of the news channels is showing the content which is knowledgeable. One is telecasting the marriage updates of celebrity bride, other is simply conducting the useless debate which was moreover a fight. Then the question which struck my mind was, Television being the most powerful source of media, Is it  its morality to show some nonsense content rather than some useful content where people blindly believe on them.
     There was a time when people used to come to know to know about some news 2-3 days after it had happened through the newspaper, But television has made the world very small where we can see the live telecast of any event. But the content which the news channel telecasts is debatable. In the race for getting maximum TRP and running the channel for 24X7, Television channels have forgotten the basic duty. They can show some knowledgeable contents like expert lectures, programmes showing events of history etc. The power of television media is such that in overnight they can change the mindset of entire world but should they misuse this power ?. Some of the news channels are been sold to be the political party where they only broadcast their manifesto and change the mindset of people which results in the improper choosing of government. In fact, NewsChannel should bring the problem of people in front of everybody so that the government takes it seriously and the immediate action is taken for it. Television media should be unbiased and should telecast the thing which is genuine and bring the real face of India on television.
